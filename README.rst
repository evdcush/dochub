WIP

A project to manage papers and notes in one location. Current codebase is just a bunch of my scripts and snippets cannabalized from other projects.

Plan is to be able to query arxiv and/or semantic scholar given some paper identifier, generate notes and bibtex entries, download the paper pdf, and organize it into a static RTD sphinx docs or something.
